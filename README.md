## In this Iris Flower Prediction project, I used machine learning (Logistic Regression with scikit-learn) to classify iris flowers. I built the frontend using HTML and CSS, and integrated the ML model into the website using Python and Flask. I used Git and GitHub for version control and deployed the site on Render.com to get a live URL.

CSS,
Jinja2,
